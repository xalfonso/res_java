# The Gatekeeper
The Keycloak Gatekeeper offers a very simple and flexible Reverse Proxy that handles all the OIDC-related authentication for upstream services. 

In this repository we provide a very basic example on how to run a keycloak gatekeeper with an upstream app. Note that we assume that Keycloak is running on the docker host and that there is no network defined.
