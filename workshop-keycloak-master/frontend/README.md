# The Frontend
Our intention is to create our very first application that uses Keycloak for authentication. We simply want to get an idea which steps are needed in order to get this done.

We use plain javascript as the framework is not important. However - feel free to use any framework you like. 

The goal is to show the content of the access token we get after a successful authentication. 

## Setup

> Configure a Keycloak client

> Add the Keycloak configuration to `js/script.js`

> Change the `index.html` to load the correct version of the `keycloak.js`

> Run the app.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081
```

## Login into your application

> Create User.

> Do not show all the user data. 

> Change the content of the access_token.

> How to determine which content is being sent to the application?
